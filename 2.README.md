## Signal test failure

### 1. signal test failure with log and fail
`testing.T` has `logf` and `log` method. Any method ends with `f` means formated string method.

There are 2 ways to signal a test has failed:
1. Fail: fail but keep running test
2. FailNow: fail now and stop running test

Usually, people will use below ways to combine fail a test and the logs. The ones ends in `f` meand formatted string method.
1. Error = Fail + log%
2. Fatal = FailNow + log

Error will allow the test to continue running.
Fatal will end the test right away.

### 2. When to use Error vs Fatal
Think about the scenarios for error vs fatal when you write the test.

### 3. Write proper error message
Format of the error message is as follows:
`t.Errorf("FuncOne(%v) err = %v; want %v", arg, got, want)`
